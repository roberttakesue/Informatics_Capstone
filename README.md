# Informatics_Capstone
A collection of PHP and HTML files used in my Senior Project at IU

This is my work for my senior capstone project, a web app called EcoEverything that was meant to be a Strava-like web app for trash pickup and other healthy environmental habits. 

The project interacted with an IU MariaDB database that our team made to handle data.
